Microsoft Windows BSD Edition Community Repository
--------------------------------------------------
Thank you for helping me with this by uploading your own packages; the default OpenBSD (Lite),
FreeBSD (Professional), and Alpine Linux (Gaming) repositories.

How do I install packages on the diffrent versions of WinBSD?
-------------------------------------------------------------
There are plans for one, lightweight version of WinBSD, based on OpenBSD in the future, but for
now, things are a little bit dicey. So, if you are using the gaming versions, you install a
package via the terminal using 'apk add <package>' for example. If you are using the lite version,
you use 'pkg_add <package>', and if you are using the professional version, you use 'pkg install <package>.

How can I view/add to the repository?
-------------------------------------
Well, you just have to scroll up to the 'files' section, because that's where everything is stored.

Thank you for using WinBSD, and I hope you spread the word and stuff. Bye for now!
